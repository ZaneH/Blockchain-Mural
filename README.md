# Blockchain Mural
This repository contains the files necessary to run a private Blockchain demonstration at the
University of Charlotte at North Carolina. This project was built to help visualize how a
Blockchain works through an interactive mural.

## How to Run
The Blockchain is still in an early stage, but to run the repository as-is, first the repo needs to be cloned.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ZaneH/Blockchain-Mural.git
```

Run a webserver inside the git directory â€“ everything will work out of the box.

The Go HTTP server is currently being served by a DigitalOcean Droplet I created while this project is in
development. The IP address is `104.131.6.207`.
